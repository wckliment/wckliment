## Hi, I’m Chase Kliment 👋

I’m a senior backend engineer and systems architect focused on designing
production-grade platforms under real-world constraints.

My work centers on:
- Backend architecture and API design
- Orchestration, validation, and data integrity layers
- Building maintainable systems that scale with evolving product needs
- Translating ambiguous business goals into clear technical solutions

I currently contribute to a confidential, early-stage platform under NDA,
working across backend architecture, system design, and technical leadership.
Public repositories here represent experiments, learning projects, or prior
work that can be shared openly.

### Areas of Focus
- Backend & systems engineering  
- API and data modeling  
- Architecture-first development  
- Python, Node.js, and TypeScript services  

### Selected Public Work
- **ikonPractice** — Custom dental SaaS platform (backend + full-stack)
- **HomeHopper** — Property and booking platform
- **BoundTogether** — Community-focused application
