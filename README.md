## Hi, I’m Chase Kliment 👋

I’m a senior backend engineer and systems architect specializing in AI-driven systems, payment workflows, and production-grade backend architecture.

I design and stabilize complex systems where reliability, data integrity, and deterministic behavior matter.

My work centers on:
- Multi-stage AI workflow orchestration (LLM routing, tool execution, validation layers)
- Stripe and webhook-driven payment systems with idempotent event handling
- API integrations and event-driven architectures
- Data modeling and normalization for scalable SaaS platforms
- Hardening fragile systems before they scale

I currently contribute to a confidential, early-stage AI platform under NDA,
working across backend architecture, workflow orchestration, and technical leadership.
Public repositories here represent experiments or prior work that can be shared openly.

### Core Technical Areas
- AI workflow orchestration (OpenAI-based systems, agent-style pipelines)
- Event-driven systems & webhook validation
- Stripe integrations & multi-step payment flows
- REST / GraphQL API design
- Relational data modeling (Postgres/MySQL)
- Python, Node.js, and TypeScript services
- Logging, observability, and failure recovery design

### Selected Professional Work

- **ikonPractice** — Custom dental SaaS platform  
  Backend architecture, API integrations, payment logic, and production deployment for a domain-specific SaaS platform.
- **MoodMe (Production Mobile App)** — Relationship intelligence platform deployed on iOS and Android  
  Contributed to backend architecture and AI orchestration systems powering multi-layer LLM workflows, structured validation pipelines, and stateful conversation logic in a live production environment.
- **MoodJi Sports (AI Systems Platform – In Development)**  
  Backend and AI workflow architecture for a sports-focused emotional intelligence platform, including multi-stage AI routing, structured tone/frequency mapping logic, and deterministic processing layers designed for scalability.
